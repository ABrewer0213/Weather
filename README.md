# Weather practice project
#Instructions - This is a simple weather project. I used Visual Studio, I just switched to using Linux and VSCode for other projects.
1. Download all the files.
2. Extract them all in the same folder.
3. Open the HTML and CSS files using visual studio. Only compatable with chrome right now
4. Right click anywhere on the code and click view in browser.
5. Type in any city.
6. NOTE - For some reason my current computer doesnt like to run the solution I believe it has something to do with Nodejs. The solution for my C# project works.
